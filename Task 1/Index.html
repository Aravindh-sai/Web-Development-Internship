                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Entrepreneurship is not just about starting a business; it's about having the right mindset to
                    overcome challenges and seize opportunities. Many people dream of becoming entrepreneurs, but few
                    succeed. What separates the winners from the rest? It all comes down to mindset, strategy, and
                    execution.</p>

                <h2>Key Traits of Successful Entrepreneurs</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3> Vision & Purpose</h3>
                        <p>A successful entrepreneur has a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They don’t just
                            start a business for the sake of making money—they want to solve problems and create value.
                            For example, Elon Musk's vision with Tesla was not just about selling cars but
                            revolutionizing sustainable energy.</p>
                           <p><b>Ask yourself:</b></p> 
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li> What problem am I solving?</li>
                            <li>How does my idea make life easier or better for people?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3> Taking Risks & Learning from Failure</h3>
                        <p>Entrepreneurs are risk-takers, but they take calculated risks. They understand that failure
                            is a part of the journey. Instead of fearing failure, they learn from it. Jeff Bezos failed
                            multiple times before Amazon became a success.</p>

                           <p><b>Key lesson:</b> Don’t be afraid to fail—be afraid of not trying.</p> 
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3> Networking & Learning from Others</h3>
                        <p>Entrepreneurs don’t succeed alone. They build strong relationships and learn from mentors.
                            Talking to experienced people can save you years of trial and error. </p>

                           <p><b>Ways to expand your network:</b></p>

                            <li> Follow successful entrepreneurs on LinkedIn.</li>
                            <li>Join online communities where entrepreneurs discuss ideas.</li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Strong Work Ethic & Discipline</h3>
                        <p> Building a business takes hard work and consistency. There are no shortcuts. Successful
                            entrepreneurs wake up early, work late, and stay disciplined even when they don’t feel like
                            it.
                            </p>

                            innovate. Think about companies like Netflix. They started with DVD rentals but quickly
                            shifted to streaming when the market changed. </p>
